//Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
//Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

//Storing person's name with whitespace
let whitespace ="\n\t Nida pervez \t\n"
console.log(whitespace)
//stripping whitespaces
let withoutspace = whitespace.trim()
console.log(withoutspace)
