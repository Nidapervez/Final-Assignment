Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. 
//Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestlist: string[] = ["Nida", "Hira", "Anum", "Umama"];
guestlist.forEach(guest => console.log(`Hi! ${guest}, would you like to have dinner with me?`));
