//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples.
//Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

//favorite mode of transportation
const favoritetransportation:string[]=["motorcycle", "car", "bicycle", "scooter", "electric skateboard"]
//Print each transportation's name by accessing each element with series of statements
for(let i=0;i<favoritetransportation.length;i++){
    console.log("I Would like to own",favoritetransportation[i],)}
