//Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
//• Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

//• Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!




// Array of favorite fruits
let favorite_fruits = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"];

// Check if "banana" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("banana")) {
    console.log("You really like bananas!");
}

// Check if "apple" is in the array
if (favorite_fruits.includes("apple")) {
    console.log("You really like apples!");
}

// Check if "kiwi" is in the array
