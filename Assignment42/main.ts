//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified


// Define an array of magician's names
let magicians = ["rahul", "rohit", "salman", "amir"];

// Define a function called show_magicians that takes an array as input and prints each name in the array
function show_magicians(names:any) {
    for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
        console.log(names[i]);
    }
}

// Define a function called make_great that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase "the Great" to each magician's name
function make_great(names:any) {
    for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
        names[i] = names[i] + " the Great";
    }
}

// Call make_great function to modify the array of magicians
make_great(magicians);

// Call show_magicians to see the modified list
show_magicians(magicians);
